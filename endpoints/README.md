# Endpoints
These endpoints use JSON to interface with the main application.
They are built on ***PHP***

### How to set up the database
1. Go to you phpmyadmin and import the complaints_app.sql. The sql file
will create the database called ***complaints_app***
2. You can start using the database.

Basic use of the endpoints is the use of form data or query string parameters to receive JSON as the reply.
